# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Report
In my project on data analytics for a coffee shop's sales report, I utilized MySQL for data management and Power BI for data visualization to provide comprehensive insights into the shop's sales performance. The project began with extracting and managing essential datasets using MySQL, which included sales transactions, product information, employee records, customer data, and a time dimension. These datasets were meticulously cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy, including the creation of calculated fields like revenue. 

Subsequently, the cleaned data was imported into Power BI, where I designed an interactive and dynamic sales report. This report featured various visualizations such as bar charts to display daily sales, line graphs for monthly sales trends, and pie charts to show the contribution of each product category to overall sales. Additionally, tables were used to highlight top-selling products and the performance of individual employees. Interactive elements like slicers and filters allowed users to explore the data dynamically, enabling detailed analysis of specific time periods, products, or employee performance.

This project provided the coffee shop's management with real-time, actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and employee contributions, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic growth. The integration of MySQL and Power BI resulted in a robust data analytics solution that significantly enhanced the shop's operational efficiency and business optimization.
